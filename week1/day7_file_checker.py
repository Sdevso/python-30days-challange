Day 7: File Operations

Challenge Description:
Create a script that performs various file system operations related to server
management, such as log rotation, disk space checking, and file monitoring.

Learning Objectives:
1. File system operations
2. File monitoring
3. Log management
4. Directory operations
5. File pattern matching

Requirements:
1. Implement functions for:
   - Log file rotation
   - Disk space monitoring
   - File change detection
   - Directory size calculation
   - File pattern matching

2. Handle various file operations:
   - Read/Write operations
   - File moving/copying
   - Pattern matching
   - Permission checking

Hints:
1. File Operations Libraries:
   - os.path for path operations
   - shutil for file operations
   - glob for pattern matching
   - watchdog for file monitoring

2. Log Rotation:
   - Check file size
   - Date-based rotation
   - Compression
   - Maintain history

3. File Monitoring Structure:
   {
       'path': '/logs/app.log',
       'size': 1048576,
       'last_modified': '2025-06-10 10:00:00',
       'permissions': '644',
       'owner': 'user'
   }

4. Pattern Matching:
   - Use glob patterns
   - Regular expressions
   - Recursive search
   - Exclusion patterns

Bonus Challenges:
1. Implement real-time file monitoring
2. Add file compression handling
3. Create file backup functionality
4. Add file integrity checking

Tips:
- Use context managers for file operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider large file handling
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Handle file locks correctly
