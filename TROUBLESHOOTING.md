# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter during the 30-day Python DevOps challenge.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Python Environment Issues

#### ModuleNotFoundError
```
Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some_module'
```
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've activated your virtual environment
2. Install the required package:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. If the issue persists, try installing the specific module:
   ```bash
   pip install some_module
   ```

#### Version Compatibility
**Issue:** Code examples not working with your Python version

**Solution:**
1. Check your Python version:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or newer
3. Update Python if needed or use a virtual environment with the correct version

### Docker-Related Issues

#### Docker Container Access Denied
**Issue:** Permission denied when running Docker commands

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Add your user to the docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
3. Log out and back in for changes to take effect

#### Container Network Issues
**Issue:** Containers can't communicate

**Solution:**
1. Check if containers are on the same network
2. Verify network configuration
3. Use Docker Compose for complex setups

### Git Issues

#### Git Push Errors
**Issue:** Unable to push changes

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Check your credentials
3. Verify repository permissions

### OS-Specific Issues

#### Windows Path Issues
**Issue:** Commands work in Unix but fail in Windows

**Solution:**
1. Use raw strings for file paths
2. Replace forward slashes with backslashes
3. Use os.path.join() for path manipulation

#### Permission Issues (Unix)
**Issue:** Permission denied when executing scripts

**Solution:**
1. Add execute permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.py
   ```
2. Run with appropriate permissions
3. Check file ownership
